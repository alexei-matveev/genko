  ;; 1. Text content:
  {:content "I am an AI-powered assistant.",
   :role "assistant",
   :tool_calls nil,
   :function_call nil,
   :annotations []}

  ;; 2. Request for tool calls:
  {:content nil,
   :role "assistant",
   :tool_calls [{:function {:name "get_weather",
                            :arguments "{\"location\":\"Berlin, Germany\"}"},

  ;; Example of a tool call:
  (chat-completion nil [{:role "user", :content "Factorial of 7?"}])
  =>
  {:content nil,
   :role "assistant",
   :tool_calls [{:function {:arguments "{\"clojure-code\":\"(reduce * (range 1 8))\"}",

;; This implementation of the `chat-with-tools` function hides from
;; the caller the exact results of the tool calls, as well as the fact
;; that the tools were used at all. The context containing the
;; transcript of all the tool calls is not visible to the caller. This
;; behavior may or may not be what the caller wants. Here is a use
;; case where the transcript would have been useful:
;;
;;   USER: sin(1.1)
;;   ASSISTANT: sin(1.1) â‰ˆ 0.8912
;;   USER: how do you know that?
;;   ASSISTANT: I calculated sin(1.1) using the mathematical sine
;;     function in Clojure code: `(Math/sin 1.1)`, which evaluates to
;;     approximately 0.8912.
;;   USER: more digits?
;;   ASSISTANT: Sure! Using the calculation from earlier, the value of
;;     sin(1.1) is approximately: 0.8912073600614354
;;
;; Without a transcript, the LLM might tell you a story about the
;; Taylor series when you ask how it arrived at the result.
