# Genko

Genko is a simple command-line tool for interactive chat with language
models or other servers supporting OpenAI's protocoll. It maintains
conversation context and supports multi-turn dialogue.

Genko can also run as a local server that implements basic OpenAI-compatible
endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models`). This allows you to interact
with Genko using HTTP requests or tools like Curl, and makes it possible to use
Genko as a backend for compatible clients.

Foremost it is a project to learn the limits of Copilot for Clojure.

## Usage

There is no default for `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`, so you need to set
both environment variables:

    $ OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/v1
    $ OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    $ lein run

Build executable in `./bin/genko`:

    $ just build

### Running the server

You can start the server with:

    $ lein run --server

Or from Cider by evaluating `(start-server)` in the `comment` section of `src/genko/server.clj`.

By default, the server listens on port 3000.

### Interacting with the server

You can interact with the server from the CLI by specifying the base URL:

    $ lein run --base-url=http://localhost:3000/v1

Or directly with Curl:

    $ curl -s http://localhost:3000/v1/models | jq
    $ curl -sXPOST http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"are you human?"}]}' | jq

For streaming responses (SSE):

    $ curl -vNXPOST http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"tell me a story!"}],"stream":true}'

## Backlog

* [ ] Mitigate Remote Code Execution in `(eval (read-string "untrusted
      input of llm"))`?
* [ ] CORS and/or Auth for the case of running the server at
      `http://localhost:3000` and accessing it from the local browser?
