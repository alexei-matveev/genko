# Genko

Genko is a simple command-line tool for interactive chat with language
models or other servers supporting OpenAI's protocoll. It maintains
conversation context and supports multi-turn dialogue.

Foremost it is a project to learn the limits of Copilot for Clojure.

## Usage

There is no default for `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`, so you need to set
both environment variables:

    $ OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/v1
    $ OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    $ lein run

Build executable in `./bin/genko`:

    $ just build
